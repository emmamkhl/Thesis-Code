Part 01 – Project Overview
What this project is

This project explores a repeat-based approach to species-specific qPCR diagnostics 
for marine aquaculture organisms. Instead of using standard single-copy or mitochondrial markers, 
it focuses on repetitive DNA as high-copy genomic targets that may improve detection sensitivity.

The code in this repository represents the full computational workflow used in my MSc dissertation, 
from raw genome files through to primer design.


Why marine aquaculture?
Marine aquaculture systems are highly vulnerable to parasites, pathogens, and invasive species. 
Early detection is essential, but many existing molecular methods struggle with:
low sensitivity
poor species specificity
reliance on conserved markers

This project looks at whether genome-wide repeat content can offer a more sensitive 
and a flexible alternative for molecular monitoring.

Why repetitive DNA?
Repetitive elements make up a large proportion of eukaryotic genomes, 
especially in non-model marine species. While often masked or ignored,
they have some useful properties for diagnostics: 
high copy number (better qPCR sensitivity) 
species-specific repeat families
abundance across the genome

Here, repeats are treated as useful signal, not background noise.

What the pipeline does, in simple terms, the workflow:
Downloads and prepares reference genomes
Identifies repeats using de novo and similarity-based tools
Filters repeats based on quality and structure
Compares repeat patterns across taxa
Clusters sequences to reduce redundancy
Designs and scores qPCR primer candidates
Each step is documented and implemented as its own “Part” in this repository.
